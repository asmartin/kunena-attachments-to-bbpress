kunena-attachments-to-bbpress
=============================

Requirements in `php.ini`:

-    `allow_url_fopen: True`
-    `disable_functions` commented out

These settings need only be set temporarily while running this script. Once the attachments are imported, you should reset the `php.ini` settings to your preferred values. Once this is done, just place the script in the root of your wordpress install and visit it in your browser.
